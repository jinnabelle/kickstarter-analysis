# Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project

Louise's play, Fever, almost met its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Curious to how play campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates
and fundraising goals, I used Excel to show this relationship.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis looks at the the relationship between funding goals and plays' outcomes. I segmented the fundraising goals by $5K increments with $1000 and below as the lowest bound and $50K as the highest bound.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. I think for outcomes based on launch date, it would be good to look at the
